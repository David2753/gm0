Notebook Designs and Decisions
=================================

This section will cover both what needs to be in the notebook and the decisions
you need to make about it affecting both individual sections and it as a whole.

Whole Notebook Decisions
========================

Condensed vs Long
-----------------

A trap a bunch of teams fall into is that a longer notebook is a better
notebook, especially if it's actually quality writing but unfortunately that's
not necessarily true.
At shorter competitions judges don't have a lot of team to read notebooks and
make decisions so even if you do write a really great huge notebook they might
be able to cross off the things off their list and you might place lower than
you should have.
The solution to this is to have a condensed notebook.
This is where you make a purposeful effort to get rid of redundancies and make
sure everything written in the notebook serves the purpose of being read and
getting things checked off of awards.
So if you know your state competitions are going to be more than a couple days
write a long, detailed filled notebook.
But if it's gonna only be a day, write with every section having a purpose.

Handwritten vs Typed
--------------------

This one is a team decision.
Some teams swear judges prefer handwritten notebooks,
but if there is reliable proof for that it is hard to come upon.
But if you're a small team or you would prefer to write, do that.
Typed notebooks are a lot easier to organize,
and judges will definetely be able to read it.

Serious vs Charming
-------------------

A team's notebook is an extension of its personality and branding.
Some teams try to come across as an engineering firm or at least very serious,
while others act the opposite.
You should try and reflect that in your notebook.
Neither way is better,
but it's good early on to figure out your team's way of acting and writing in a
manner that fits it.

.. note::
    Having a consistent team brand is important so judges remember you.
    A large amount of winning awards is being
    remembered and advocated for by the judges.
    Therefore, having consistent branding helps judges know what team they are
    talking to and what they know about you.

Individual sections
===================

Section 9.2.2 of |gm1|, lists out the type of things that are expected to see
in your notebook.

They are listed here:

* Problem Definition
* Information Gathering
* Brainstorming Solutions
* Concept Design
* System Level Design
* Testing
* Design Improvement
* Production
* Promotion
* Budgeting
* Planning
* Outreach

Specific sections named in |gm1|, the Judges Manual, and Notebook Guidelines
are not plentiful, only including a team plan
(which is pretty much all non robot writing including a sustainability plan,
a strategic plan, and a business plan all fall into it,
and doing one of these sections is required for Inspire award)
and telling us what they want in the notebook (listed above).
It falls to the individual notebook writers to figure out what they
specifically want to call each section and what to put in each section.

Daily Logs and Other Ways of Documenting
----------------------------------------

This might be the most common way of documenting in notebooks.
Even teams that are so-so about attempting to write a notebook have a couple
months worth of logs because overall they are not that hard to do.

Each team approaches it differently but your most standard way of doing looks
like this:

    Date

    Members of Team Present

    +------------------+---------------------------------------------+
    | Tasks & Pictures | More Information, if the Task Was Completed |
    +==================+=============================================+
    | Lorem ipsum      | Dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit |
    +------------------+---------------------------------------------+
    |Sed do eiusmod    | Tempor incididunt  ut labore                |
    +------------------+---------------------------------------------+
    |Et dolore magna   | Aliqua ut enim ad minim veniam              |
    +------------------+---------------------------------------------+

There are other methods such as weekly, pure goals,
or other engineering based things such as agile
(if you pursue the latter you can use those hard won mentors you have gotten).
Weekly or bi-weekly is the same as above but the date becomes a range and you
talk about what happened over that period of time.
This is better for a team that has only a couple of people doing the logs
because overall logs get more and more tedious.

Pure goals is simply this:

    +------+--------------------+---------------------------------+
    | Date | Goal and Goal Date | Was the Goal Completed in Time? |
    +======+====================+=================================+
    | Quis | Nostrud            | Exercitation ullamco            |
    +------+--------------------+---------------------------------+
    | Nisi | Ut aliquip ex ea   | Commodo consequat               |
    +------+--------------------+---------------------------------+
    | Duis | Aute irure dolor   | In reprehenderit in voluptate   |
    +------+--------------------+---------------------------------+

Building Section and Documenting the Robot
==========================================
You have spent a bunch of time reading the rest of this manual to learn about
the robot and how to build it.
The building section is mostly about two things:
what is your robot made of and how does it do the challenge,
and what were the driving factors in the way you built your robot.
The robot parts and explanation of use is talking about design;
therefore pictures of the parts and captioning to help judges understand how it
works and why it is useful
(use math in these explanations to target Think award).
The second part is much more documentation heavy (at least in my experience)
but in some ways it is easier.
As you are building a robot,
you will not get your final bot in the first attempt.
Each time you iterate upon a part of your robot, document it.
Write about a few things: why did you use this part,
what was good and bad about the part,
and what are you changing for the next design.
This also includes your first unrealized ideas that your team talked about
right when the team came together after the season was released.
